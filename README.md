# solidfire_cluster_check
Python scripts for checking SolidFire cluster health.  These scripts log into a cluster via HTTP or ElementFactory,
gather node and cluster information, then format it for easy viewing.

This is a re-write of an older script to use Python 3.4 and above and add new display fields.
